Mechanical Engineer (BS/MS with highest honors, NTUA) and Aerospace Engineering Ph.D. candidate at The University of Texas at Austin with a wide programming and mathematical background in computational engineering, optimization, controls, fluid dynamics, and machine learning. Currently, I leverage machine learning models to control infinite-dimensional, nonlinear systems described by partial differential equations, such as turbulent flows: a mathematically and practically challenging topic. I have also worked extensively on environment perception and estimation problems in the industry for automotive applications, such as Radar mapping and fusing computer vision with HD maps.

I'm always looking for challenging problems with a purpose to work on!
