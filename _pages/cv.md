**Graduate Researcher**, The University of Texas at Austin

-   Research interests:

    -   Data-driven control of high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical
        systems.

    -   Reduced-order modeling of turbulent flows using modal analysis
        and non-parametric methods.

        reduced-order models.

    -   Stochastic optimal control with learned non-parametric models
        (Gaussian processes).

    -   Reinforcement-learning for flow control.

    -   Motion prediction in autonomous driving settings using
        Transformers and Gaussian processes.

    -   Computational engineering and high-performance computing with an
        emphasis on direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows.

**Undergraduate/Associate Researcher**, National Technical University of

    -   Adjoint-based optimization of partial differential equations
        (e.g. aerodynamic shape optimization).

    -   Grid generation and manipulation; computational geometry.

    -   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

    software for simulating the deformation of an inflatable wing.

-   Programmed an adjoint error-based grid refinement tool for the
    OpenFOAM environment for use in automatic mesh generation and for
    improving the accuracy of computing functionals of interest.
