Control of fluid flows is a problem that presents a number of modeling and control design challenges. 
Fluid flows are infinite-dimensional, nonlinear, and, often, chaotic dynamical systems governed by a set of partial differential 
equations -- the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations -- whose solution is computationally intractable for control purposes. 
For that reason, any attempt in model-based control requires a model-reduction step (e.g. if a high-dimensional dynamical model, 
such as the linearized NS equations, is available) and/or a system identification step (if only numerical or experimental data are available).

Here is a list of some of the publications and presentations on flow control that I have worked on:

- [Control of Large-Scale Motions in Boundary Layers | APS DFD 2021](/publications/2021-11-19-control-of-lsms/)
- [Model Predictive Control of Material Volumes with Application to Vortical Structures | AIAA Journal 2021](/publications/2021-07-07-MPC-of-LSMs/)
- [Estimation and Control of Fluid Flows Using Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition | IEEE L-CSS](/publications/2020-08-10-sparsity-promoting-dmd-with-control/)
