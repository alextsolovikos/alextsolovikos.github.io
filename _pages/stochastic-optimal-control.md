Here is a list of some of the publications and presentations on stochastic optimal control that I have worked on:

- [Cautious Nonlinear Covariance Steering using Variational Gaussian Process Predictive Models, MECC 2021](/publications/2021-10-25-cautious-covariance-steering/)
- [Distributed Covariance Steering with Consensus ADMM for Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems, RSS 2021](/publications/2021-07-13-Distributed-Covariance-Steering/)
- [Greedy Finite-Horizon Covariance Steering for Discrete-Time Stochastic Nonlinear Systems Based on the Unscented Transform, ACC 2020](/publications/2020-07-01-greedy-nonlinear-covariance-steering/)
