Mechanical Engineer (BS/MS with highest honors, NTUA) and Aerospace Engineering Ph.D. candidate at The University of Texas at Austin with a wide programming and mathematical background in computational engineering, optimization, controls, and machine learning. Currently, I leverage machine learning models to control infinite-dimensional, nonlinear systems described by partial differential equations: a mathematically and practically challenging topic. I have also worked extensively on environment perception and estimation problems in the industry, such as fusing vision with HD maps and Radar mapping.

I'm always looking for challenging problems with a purpose to work on!
